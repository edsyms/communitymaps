The sheer diversity of this food system almost guarantees that if one crop should fail there will likely be another to fall back on, and a focus on low input plants which perform multiple functions at once, such as a windbreak comprised of nut pine which produce edible nuts means that this system is not only diverse, but relatively easy to maintain.",Teal Farm,Huntington,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1B7uerpjEA"" target=""_blank"">More on this project</a>","410 Camels Hump Rd, ",Vermont,United States,3,PR,Perennial Food Systems,Whole Systems Design,Randy Fredericks,Town

This has been accomplished through the use of a viewing window that allows for moisture levels to be monitored, and a ventilation system that allows for the amount of air flow in the hive to be controlled if condensation becomes an issue. This means that it is more likely that the hive will survive, allowing for more bees to start gathering nectar and pollinating plants during the warmer months.",Beehive Demonstration Site,Digby,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUX3qXF0ps4"" target=""_blank"">More on this project</a>","35 Industrial Dr, ",Nova Scotia,Canada,4,BS,Beehives,Manzer Apiary Inc,Randy Fredericks,Large Town
