<h1> Valuing convenience in public transportation </h1>

<p style="color:white"> Convenience is an important factor when dealing with public transportation. One of the most innovative convenient methods of public transportation is in Helsinki, Finland where a minibus service has been set up which lets users pick their own route b placing certain pick-up and destination locations via a smartphone.  This service will then calculate a best route that is the most efficient (time and energy wise). </p> </a>
