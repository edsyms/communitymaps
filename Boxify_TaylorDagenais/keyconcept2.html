<h1> Cost Efficient Transportation in Medellin, Columbia </h1>

<p style="color:white"> A cost efficient approach to public transportation has been implemented in Medellin, Columbia where cable cars have been established.  These cable cars are relatively inexpensive to install and to run resulting in a very economic friendly means for transportation. 

Other cost efficient means of transportation that have been widely developed are "freedom bikes" where individuals can pay money and receive a bicylcle to use. Some of the locations that have set up these locations are Mexico and Paris, France. </p> </a>
