		<p class="intro">This web page is going to taking a look at how technology effects us in our everyday life that you might not have thought of. This web page also has some links to other web pages that will give you more information on the topic. Another aspect of technology that this web page will look at is the elegant side of technology. </p>

		<p class="intro">Technology is becoming a large part of our and we have yet to realize it. For example when the power goes out for even an hour, and when the power comes back on everyone turns on their TV or computer and then goes on the web to see what they have missed in just the hour that they have been off line due to the power outage. Most people are hooked to either their phones or to their computers; so much so that when you are trying to talking to someone and they are just glued to their phones and who even look up to talk to you they will just keep on typing away on their phones, so there is not much eye contact there when someone does that and it takes away from the person to person connection.</p>
		
		<p class="intro"> The map below was created in CartoDB. There are three locations highlight on the map. The first point on the map is that of MIT that is located in Boston. Then the second point on the map is IMB and that point is focused on the smart planet section of the IBM web page. Then the last point that is found on the map is all about Chicago. Chicago has been in the news lately due to the Big Data that they are using, but anyways I will let you read more about it on their web page. For each of the points stated above there is a link to each of their web pages and that is where you can find more information about each topic. </p>

		<h2> Technology Addicts </h2>
		<p class="main">"When I was a child, Saturday was my favorite day of the week. On Saturday, all of the networks ran cartoons from early morning until noon. All morning, I would veg out while watching my favorite shows, with occasional breaks to bounce around the room pretending I was some superhero. One day I was strolling along the shore of one of the Great Lakes with my father and my Grandfather. Somehow I must have brought up the subject of Saturday morning cartoons. My dad told me that when he was a kid, they did not have televisions. My Grandfather took it one step farther, stating that when he was my age, they did not even have radios. I thought about this for a moment, then I turned to my Grandfather and asked, "What did you do on Cartoon Day?"
		My Grandfather was born right after the turn of the century, at the beginning of the technological explosion that was the Twentieth Century. When he was a child, they had no electricity, no indoor plumbing, no phone. He lived on a farm where they produced almost everything they needed, or they went without. There were no superstores, no convenience stores, and no strip malls. Every few weeks they went to town for supplies. Otherwise, they made do with what they had. If they wanted to go somewhere, they walked. Or they hitched up the horse to the wagon. If they needed to travel more than 20 miles, they boarded a train. For the most part, however, everything they needed could be found at home, or within a five mile radius."</p>

	<h2> Technology In Relation To Everyday Life </h2>
	<p class="main">This section will talk all about the elegance of technology. All the information cames from the web page <a href="http://www.resilience.org/stories/2006-11-07/elegant-technology">Resilience</a>. "Every now and then I get the sense that some people see me as a “doomer.” That I’m perceived as a bit of a pessimist about the future. I don’t know why. In the face of issues like peak oil, global warming, catabolic collapse, I don’t see any need for our quality of life to decrease. I do see a need for our quantity and mode of consumption to decrease—and I think some people are confusing the two. Many people are labeled “doomer” simply because they reject the general idea that technology will be able to save us from all our problems and guarantee the maintenance (even perpetual increase) of our consumer-driven society. I think that this demonstrates a failure to grasp two critical concepts—that extreme consumption does not equate to quality of life, and that technological complexification is not, in itself, of any value."
	</p>

		<p class="main"> "Technology is only of value to the degree that it provides for quality of life without creating negative power-relationships that outweigh that benefit. And such technology does not have to be complex or "advanced" at all. Technology is nothing more than "knowledge of technics" or knowledge of a technique - knowledge is power. A thin photovoltaic array or a genetically engineered bacterium that converts woody biomass to ethanol both represent technology. The question that we must ask is "does the quality of life provided by this technology outweigh the decrease of our quality of life from the power-relationships that we must enter in to in order to employ this technology?" As a general rule, when the answer is yes, the result is something that may be accurately described as "elegant simplicity." When the answer is no, as I think it is with both the example of photovoltaics and biotech-ethanol, then the result is not "elegant simplicity." In fact, because I am using "elegant" not in the vernacular, but as a term of art, the phrase "elegant simplicity" is actually redundant: “elegant” alone will suffice, because I use that term to imply a measure of simplicity—that the benefit from an "elegant" technology outweighs burden of the incurred hierarchy, when measured from the perspective of the median (not mean) individual." </p>
