Community Resilience

Large or small, urban or rural, communities today face many challenges. How does a community sort out all at once the impacts of economic volatility, land scarcity, an aging population, growing poverty, rising energy costs, and climate change? How do we decide what is most important given our community&rsquo;s community’s assets and challenges? How do we mobilize ourselves to respond as a group, as well as individually?

Resilience - the ability to respond and adapt to change creatively and collaboratively - may be the most important quality a community needs to deal with today’s uncertainty. Unless a community develops a capacity to assess, learn, adapt, and innovate all the time, it won't do well in the future that is coming at us. It won’t thrive (or perhaps even survive) unless it is resilient.

But what are the signs of a resilient community? A resilient community is …

    A “can-do” community. The people are open to new ideas, to learning and to diversity. They co-operate with each other to make things happen.
    A learning community. The people have assessed the threats and opportunities ahead of them, created a vision, and identified priorities and plans to get there. The vision considers social, economic and environmental health. Organizations and local governments co-operate with each other to take action and to assess and learn from their progress.
    A caring community. Part of the planning and action ensures that those most in need continue to get access to essential services such as food, housing, water, and energy.
    A self-reliant community. The community is strategic in how it works to diversify land use, food production, community services, business, and labour market skills. Local ownership of land, investment capital, and business – is a priority.

“If we want to thrive, we need to move from a growth imperative to a resilience imperative”
(Thomas Homer-Dixon)

CCCR’s Approach

Resilience is not something you fix. It can be learned or developed. Communities can strengthen the attitudes and behaviours characteristic of resilience.

    One way CCCR does this is through the Transition Town model. It is useful for communities that want to animate grassroots organizing and action to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and respond creatively to climate change. CCCR is seeding this international movement in Canada and helping it grow through an accredited staff member who delivers a 2-day Transition Town Workshop.
    A second way is through training and coaching people in the application of the Community Resilience Manual. The first part of this publication, The Guide, explains the 23 characteristics of resilient communities and the steps to take if you want to assess and strengthen your resilience. The second part, The Workbook, provides data collection forms, survey tools, sample invitations, and other resources to support your resilience process. This resource has been used by several communities and regions in several countries over the past ten years to assess their resilience and organize for community-wide action. Find out more.

		<p class="main"><h3>What is Food Security?</h3>
<p><strong>Food Security means that all people at all times  have physical &amp; economic access to adequate amounts of nutritious, safe,  and culturally appropriate foods</strong>, which are produced in an environmentally  sustainable and socially just manner, and that people are able to make informed  decisions about their food choices.</p>
<p>Food Security also means that the people who  produce our food are able to earn a decent, living wage growing, catching,  producing, processing, transporting, retailing, and serving food.</p>
<p>At the core of food security is access to  healthy food and optimal nutrition for all. Food access is closely linked to  food supply, so food security is dependent on a healthy and sustainable food  system. </p>
<p>The food system includes the production,  processing, distribution, marketing, acquisition, and consumption of food.</p>
<h3>Sustainable Food Systems</h3>
<p>A healthy, sustainable  food system is one that focuses on Environmental Health, Economic Vitality, and  Human Health &amp; Social Equity.</p>
<h3><img src="http://redirect.main-hosting.com/error404.php/5?domain=cogsmapping.t15.org" alt="Food System Diagram" width="400" class="center"></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Environmental  Health</strong> &ndash; ensures that food production and procurement do not compromise the  land, air, or water now or for future generations.</li>
  <li><strong>Economic Vitality</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>ensures that the people who are  producing our food are able to earn a decent living wage doing so. This ensures  that producers can continue to produce our food. </li>
  <li><strong>Human Health  &amp; Social Equity </strong>&ndash; ensures that particular importance is placed on  community development and the health of the community, making sure that healthy  foods are available economically and physically to the community and that  people are able to access these foods in a dignified manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Food Security in Newfoundland and Labrador</h3>
<p>As a geographically  isolated province, Newfoundland and Labrador faces a unique set of food  security challenges: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, as a province, we are <a href="http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/nr/agrifoods/marketing/wholesale_report.pdf">producing only  10% of the fresh vegetables available at major wholesalers</a>,  and as a result of this we have an estimated 2 to 3 day supply of fresh  vegetables in the event of a crisis that disrupts the supply chain. Recent  examples of food supply crises in Newfoundland and Labrador include Hurricane  Igor, which shut down many roads in eastern Newfoundland for days, and the  labour lock-out at the Port of Montreal, which threatened to stop more than  half of the food shipments coming to the island.</li>
  <li>There are also challenges we face in terms of  expanding production. <a href="http://www29.statcan.gc.ca/ceag-web/eng/community-agriculture-profile-profil-agricole?geoId=100000000&amp;selectedVarIds=360,">The average age of farmers in the province is 55 and continues to rise</a>. And new  farmers face hurdles with access to land, access to capital, and availability  of labour.</li>
  <li>Currently most fish products produced locally  are exported.</li>
  <li>Many rural and remote communities do not have a  population large enough to support a full local grocery store so many residents  depend on transportation over long distances to buy healthy food.</li>
  <li>Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have the <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/health90b-eng.htm">lowest  rate among the provinces of consumption of at least 5 fruits and vegetables per  day</a>.</li>
  <li>NL has the highest rate of per capita <a href="http://www.feednovascotia.ca/images/HungerCount2011.pdf">food bank  usage in Canada</a> (5.6% of the population in 2011).</li>
  <li>The province has the <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/health82b-eng.htm">highest rate of overweight  and obese people in Canada</a> (63.2%) and the <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/health54b-eng.htm">second highest rate of diabetes in Canada</a> (8.3%).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://redirect.main-hosting.com/error404.php/5?domain=cogsmapping.t15.org" width="180" height="139" class="floatright">Despite these  challenges, Newfoundland and Labrador has a strong tradition of individuals  growing, hunting, fishing, preparing, and preserving local food.</p>
<p>The province has an abundance of wild foods  ranging from berries and teas to wild game and fish. Some wild berries in the  province include blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries,  Saskatoon berries, bakeapples, partridge berries, and cranberries.</p>
<p>Elliston, on the Bonavista peninsula, is known  as the root cellar capital of the world. Root cellars were used across the  province to store root crops over the winter. FSN has chosen the Root Cellar as a symbol of Newfoundland   &amp; Labrador&rsquo;s unique agricultural heritage and current potential for   increased food self-sufficiency in it's <a href="http://rootcellarsrock.ca/">Root Cellars Rock</a> project.</p>
<img class="floatleft" alt="Turnip" src="http://redirect.main-hosting.com/error404.php/5?domain=cogsmapping.t15.org">
<h3>The Food Security Continuum</h3>
<p>The Food Security  Continuum helps to illustrate the complexity of food security and the various  types of work that can be done to address some of the food security challenges  we face. Food security work often happens in this order, moving from short-term  relief towards longer term systems change and policy work.</p>
<p> Some food security programs are combinations of these stages  (an example would be a food bank which also offers a community kitchen program to  its users).</p>
<h5>1. Emergency and Short-Term Relief Strategies</h5>
<p>The first stage of the  continuum is the Short Term Relief Stage, or Emergency Food Relief work. This stage  is focused on supporting those who are most food insecure and in need of food  immediately.</p>
<p>Examples include soup kitchens, food banks, school lunch programs, and other  programs that give food to people in need without requiring any type of  commitment in return. These initiatives provide short-term relief for the immediate problem of  hunger, but do not deal with the underlying problems that cause food  insecurity, such as poverty, long-term access to food, and food skills. There are many such programs in Newfoundland and  Labrador. Our province has the highest rate of per capita <a href="http://www.feednovascotia.ca/images/HungerCount2011.pdf">food bank  usage in Canada</a> (5.6% of the population in 2011).  </p>
<p><strong>Examples  in Newfoundland and Labrador include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Community and Church sponsored food banks</li>
  <li>Status of Women Councils and Women&rsquo;s Centres</li>
  <li>School Lunch Association</li>
</ul>
<h5>2. Capacity Building Strategies</h5>

<p>Capacity Building Strategies focus on building  individual and community skills that will help communities become more food  secure. FSN focuses on supporting this kind of work in communities  across the province. This can include education and capacity building around  gardening, wild food harvesting, cooking, preserving foods, and also social  support network building. These activities help provide individuals and  communities with the basic food skills needed to feed themselves and their  families and help them to rely less on outside food sources or give-aways.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Individual  skill-building strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Programs  where individuals gain knowledge and develop skills to grow, gather, catch,  produce, prepare, or preserve their own food.</li>
  <li>Examples  include cooking classes, composting and vegetable gardening workshops, and teaching  traditional food customs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community skill-building strategies: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Programs  that allow people a chance to come together and develop social support  networks. </li>
  <li>Examples  include community gardens, community kitchens, farmers&rsquo; markets, food co-ops,  &ldquo;buy local&rdquo; campaigns, and food buying clubs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples in Newfoundland and Labrador:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Farmers&rsquo;  markets in the province have grown  to ten full-season and part-season  markets in the past 5 years.</li>
  <li>Community  gardens and school gardens are increasing in number.</li>
  <li>A  Buy Local! Buy Fresh! Avalon Region map was produced by the four Avalon  economic development boards for the first time in 2010 with 25 participating  farms.</li>
  <li>The  &ldquo;Buy Local - Keep it in Kittiwake&rdquo; program, launched in 2007 by the Kittiwake  Economic Development Corporation, educates consumers on the positives of  buying local and provides retailers and restaurants with a database of local  farmers from which to source their food. </li>
</ul>
